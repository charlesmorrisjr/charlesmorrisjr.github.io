									<h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>
									
									<h4>Introduction</h4>
									<p>I've always been interested in computers and technology. When I was a teenager, I remember getting a beginner's book at the library on how to make simple web pages. That was the start of my journey. Over the years, I learned game development, full-stack web development, database development, content management systems, networking, Linux, server administration, and more.</p>
									<p>I began my Computer Science program in 2021 to fill in the gaps in my knowledge and help me prepare to work professionally. I learned many different concepts, such as software design, security, data structures and algorithms, logic, troubleshooting, testing, agile methodology, the software development lifecycle, machine learning, and data analysis. I also learned how to develop desktop, mobile, and web applications in various languages such as C++, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin, and Python.</p>
									<p>In addition, working through my degree has helped me develop the soft skills necessary to thrive in a corporate environment, such as time management, communication, and incorporating feedback from others. </p>
									
									<br>
									
									<h4>Examples</h4>

										<img src="images/WeightTracker Mobile App.PNG" />
									</div>
									<p>In CS 360, I developed a simple weight tracking app that allowed users to create an account, log in, and enter their weight every day. Their weights were displayed in a list that showed their progress over time. Once a user reached their target weight, they would be notified with a popup and an SMS notification.</p>

									</div>
									<p>In CS 305, I created a security certificate to allow the user to connect to the server using HTTPS, ensuring that client/server communication is secure. Then, I ran a dependency check to test for vulnerabilities while suppressing false positives that could confuse future developers.</p>

									</div>
									<p>In CS 255, I took a client's business requirements and designed an application that would fulfill their needs using tools like Gantt charts, use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and class diagrams. I learned about the importance process and object modeling, functional and nonfunctional requirements, security, and system limitations.</p>

									<h4>Capstone Project</h4>
									<div class="image main" data-position="center">
										<img src="images/Travlr Getaways Home.jpg" alt="Travlr Getaways Home" />
									</div>
									<p>For my capstone project, I decided to revisit Travlr Getaways, a website I worked on in a previous course that allowed users to book vacation packages. Initially, the website was completely static. I updated the site's Travel section into a full-stack application that pulled information from a MongoDB database. I also added a single-page application allowing site administrators to modify travel packages without coding.</p>
									<p>To improve the website further, I decided to enhance its functionality by updating the Rooms section from a static webpage to a full-stack application, similar to what I did for the Travel section. I added a section to the single-page application allowing administrators to modify the available rooms. This project demonstrated my ability to take the knowledge I learned in my studies and implement it in new ways. </p>

									<h3>Code Review</h3>
									<p>Before I updated my original project, I performed a code review to find bugs, improve code quality, and ensure that the code meets industry standards. Code review is essential because it helps computer science professionals prevent errors before they happen, identify security vulnerabilities, encourage accountability, and reduce technical debt.</p>
									<p>In my previous course, CS 465: Full Stack Development I, I took a static vacation booking website called Travlr Getaways and turned the Travel section into a full-stack application using the MEAN stack. On the customer-facing side, users can view the travel packages that are available to them. These packages are pulled from a database and rendered into a web page for the user to view. A single-page application allows administrators to add, modify, and remove available travel packages. For my capstone project, I decided to change the Room section of the website from a static webpage into a full-stack application similar to the Travel section.</p>

									<h3>Software Design and Engineering</h3>
								</header>
								<p>For this enhancement, I began by working on the customer-facing website. I changed the <i>rooms.html</i> file into a Handlebars template and added JavaScript files in the routes and controllers folders to allow Express to serve the file correctly. The process was relatively straightforward aside from one problem. The <i>header.hbs</i> file always styled the "Travel" menu heading as "selected," even if I was on the "Rooms" page. I had to add code to <i>rooms.js</i> and <i>travel.js</i> in the controllers folder to pass an object named <i>currentPage</i> to <i>header.hbs</i> to designate which menu heading was selected.</p>

								<br/>
								<div class="image main" data-position="center">
									<img src="images/Travlr Getaways rooms.hbs.PNG" />
								</div>								
								<p>The next part of the enhancement involved adding a new page to the single-page application to allow administrators to modify the available rooms to choose from. I had to create the Angular components <i>add-room</i>, <i>edit-room</i>, and <i>rooms</i>. These components are analogous to existing components for displaying, adding, and editing trips. I also added a new link on the navbar so administrators could switch between viewing trips and rooms. </p>
								<div class="image main" data-position="center">
									<img src="images/Travlr Getaways edit-room.component.ts.PNG" />
								</div>								
								<p>I also updated the styling of the navbar to make it more readable and added cancel buttons to the forms for adding and editing trips and rooms.</p>

									<h3>Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
								</header>
								<p>For this enhancement, it was necessary to create a new data structure to hold the data for the rooms. This includes each room's code, name, price per day, image link, and description. I created the data structure by taking and modifying the data structure used by the trips in my project since it was similar.</p>

									<h3>Databases</h3>
								</header>
								<p>For this enhancement, I created a new collection in MongoDB to hold data for the Room section of the website. The data included each room's code, name, price per day, image link, and description. Previously, the data was stored in hard-coded JSON files. I added code to retrieve and store the data in the MongoDB database instead, which is displayed on the customer-facing website and the single-page application.</p>
